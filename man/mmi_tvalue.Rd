\usage{
mmi_tvalue(
  M_FULL,
  dataset,
  exp.names,
  ranef,
  indicator,
  family,
  t.subset = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{= dataset containing y and all x covariates. should be scaled and centered (mean = 0, sd = 1)}

\item{exp.names}{= explanatory covariate names, passed as vector of characters}

\item{indicator}{= y variable of interest (character)}

\item{family}{= GLM family distribution, takes 'gaussian' or 'Gamma'}
}
\description{
Function builds GLM, runs multi-model inference to produce: 
1. Standardized t-values (and standard error) for each covariate across full model set (effect sizes)
2. R-squareds of each model < 7 AICc of top model
3. Predicted y across each covariate, weighted by AIC for all models < 7 AICc of top model (and variance in predictions)
